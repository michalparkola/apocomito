## Core Philosophy

**Discovery Over Validation**: The goal is to learn something new and actionable in every interview, not to confirm what you already believe.

**Key Principle**: "If you don't come away knowing something new and actionable at the end of the interview, you've wasted your time and theirs."

**Mindset**: Actively search for information that contradicts your assumptions. Surprises are where real learning happens.

## The Five-Step Process

### Step 1: Define Learning Goals

Establish what you need to understand about potential customers:

- **Customer Profile**: Who they are, role, company size, industry
- **Outcomes**: What they must deliver monthly/quarterly
- **Daily Workflows**: Tools they use, processes they follow
- **Pain Points**: Current problems and how they cope
- **Budget**: Pricing tolerance and constraints
- **Trigger Moments**: What causes them to seek solutions
- **Distribution**: How they discover and evaluate products
- **Language**: Industry terminology and mental models

**What NOT to ask**: Don't ask customers what features to build—this rarely produces useful information.

### Step 2: Document Hypotheses

**Before any interviews**, write down your current assumptions:

- Forces you to be explicit about what you believe
- Prevents confirmation bias and retroactive belief adjustment
- Allows you to track which hypotheses were validated or invalidated
- Science shows predictions written down are more accurate than post-hoc explanations

**Example**: Jason's WP Engine had 18 hypotheses about blogger behavior—half proved incorrect.

**Format**: Create a spreadsheet with:
- Column 1: Hypothesis statement
- Column 2+: Notes from each interview
- Track: Confirmed / Invalidated / Needs refinement

### Step 3: Craft Open-Ended Questions

Transform hypotheses into unbiased questions that invite discovery:

**Bad (Leading)**: "Blogs get hacked constantly, right?"
**Good (Discovery)**: "Do you think about website security? What do you do about it?"

**Technique**: Ask about specific behaviors, not opinions or future intentions
- "Walk me through the last time you..."
- "What did you do when..."
- "How do you currently handle..."

### Step 4: Iterate Based on Findings

**During interviews**:
- Document responses alongside hypotheses
- When surprises emerge → dig deeper with follow-up questions
- Note exact phrases customers use (their language matters)
- Look for patterns across interviews

**After each interview**:
- Update hypothesis validation status
- Create new hypotheses from unexpected discoveries
- Refine questions based on what you learned
- Identify areas needing more exploration

**Key Quote**: "The most exciting phrase in science isn't 'eureka,' but rather, 'that's funny.'"

### Step 5: Conclude When Learning Plateaus

Stop interviewing when:
- Patterns have stabilized
- Surprises cease
- You're hearing the same information repeatedly

**Minimum**: 3 interviews is typically insufficient
**Reality**: Continue until genuine saturation occurs (often 10-20 interviews depending on segment complexity)

## Advanced Techniques

### Emergent Segmentation

**Watch for**: Fundamentally different customer groups with distinct needs

**Action**: Create separate hypothesis spreadsheets per segment

**Example**: B2B vs. B2C might need entirely different value propositions

### Price Discussion

**Why**: Include specific pricing scenarios to reveal true value perception

**How**: Present concrete prices and observe emotional reactions
- "If this cost $500/month, would that work?"
- "What budget would you need approval for?"

**Learning**: People often claim features matter but won't pay for them—critical distinction

### Workflow Walkthrough

**Technique**: Ask customers to walk through their actual daily/weekly process in detail

**Benefits**:
- Reveals tools they actually use (not just what they say they use)
- Uncovers pain points they've normalized and forgotten
- Shows where your solution would fit in real workflow

## How Claude Code Can Help You Use This Method

### 1. Hypothesis Formulation
**I can help you**:
- Review your business ideas and extract implicit hypotheses
- Structure vague assumptions into testable hypothesis statements
- Identify gaps in your hypothesis coverage
- Organize hypotheses by category (customer profile, pain points, pricing, etc.)

### 2. Question Design
**I can help you**:
- Transform hypotheses into open-ended, non-leading questions
- Review your interview scripts for bias or leading language
- Suggest follow-up questions based on hypothesis areas
- Create question flows that build naturally

### 3. Interview Analysis
**I can help you**:
- Review interview notes and identify key learnings
- Track which hypotheses were confirmed/invalidated across interviews
- Spot patterns and contradictions across multiple interviews
- Identify when you've reached saturation vs. need more data
- Extract customer language and terminology for your messaging

### 4. Hypothesis Iteration
**I can help you**:
- Generate new hypotheses based on interview surprises
- Refine existing hypotheses that were partially validated
- Identify which areas need deeper exploration
- Suggest when to create separate segments

### 5. Documentation
**I can help you**:
- Structure your hypothesis tracking spreadsheet
- Organize interview notes by theme
- Create summaries of learnings across interviews
- Document evolving customer understanding

### 6. Accountability
**I can help you**:
- Track how many interviews you've completed
- Remind you to document hypotheses BEFORE interviews
- Check if you're asking discovery questions vs. leading questions
- Identify when you're falling into confirmation bias

## Workflow with Claude Code

### Before Interviews
1. Share your business idea/assumptions
2. I'll help extract and formulate hypotheses
3. I'll help craft open-ended questions from those hypotheses
4. I'll review for bias and suggest improvements

### After Each Interview
1. Share interview notes with me
2. I'll help analyze against hypotheses
3. I'll identify surprises and suggest follow-up questions
4. I'll help generate new hypotheses from learnings

### After Multiple Interviews
1. Share notes from all interviews
2. I'll identify patterns and contradictions
3. I'll help determine if you've reached saturation
4. I'll help synthesize learnings into actionable insights

## Red Flags to Watch For

**Signs You're Doing It Wrong**:
- Every interview confirms what you already believed
- You're not documenting hypotheses before interviews
- You're asking "Would you use this feature?" type questions
- You're pitching your solution instead of listening
- You stop after 2-3 interviews because you "learned enough"
- You're not hearing any surprises

**Signs You're Doing It Right**:
- You're genuinely surprised by at least 30-50% of what you hear
- Multiple hypotheses are being invalidated
- You're discovering new customer segments you hadn't considered
- Customers are using different language than you expected
- You're finding pain points you didn't anticipate
- You're excited to do more interviews to explore discoveries

## Integration with Your Founder Profile

Given your patterns:
- **Procrastination challenge**: I can help you create micro-deadlines for interview milestones
- **Abstract ideas risk**: This method grounds ideas in real commercial needs
- **ADHD support**: Clear structure with defined steps and completion criteria
- **Accountability**: I can track your progress through the methodology

This method directly addresses your pattern #2 failure mode: "too abstract ideas not rooted in actual commercially viable needs."
